    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This smash burger recipe creates juicy burgers with crispy edges by using meat that is at least 80/20 and cooking them outdoors to avoid kitchen smoke. Grill them up quickly with high heat for a delicious and memorable dining experience.
    </p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>   
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper </li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
